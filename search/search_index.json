For each byte, grab the LSB and add it to your decoded message. Once you\u2019ve gone through each byte, convert all the LSBs you grabbed into text or a file. (You can use your file signature knowledge here!)\n\n\nWhat other types of steganography are there?\n\n\nSteganography is hard for the defense side, because there\u2019s practically an infinite number of ways it could be carried out. Here are a few examples:\n- LSB steganography: different bits, different bit combinations\n- Encode in every certain number of bytes \n- Use a password\n- Hide in different places\n- Use encryption on top of steganography",

Stream Ciphers encrypt pseudorandom sequences with bits of plaintext in order to generate ciphertext, usually with XOR. A good way to think about Stream Ciphers is to think of them as generating one-time pads from a given state. \n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\nA \nkeystream\n is a sequence of pseudorandom digits which extend to the length of the plaintext in order to uniquely encrypt each character based on the corresponding digit in the keystream\n\n\n\n\nOne Time Pads\n\n\nA \none time pad\n is an encryption mechanism whereby the entire plaintext is XOR'd with a random sequence of numbers in order to generate a random ciphertext. The advantage of the one time pad is that it offers an immense amount of security BUT in order for it to be useful, the randomly generated key must be distributed on a separate secure channel, meaning that one time pads have little use in modern day cryptographic applications on the internet. Stream ciphers extend upon this idea by using a key, usually 128 bit in length, in order to seed a pseudorandom \nkeystream\n which is used to encrypt the text.\n\n\nTypes of Stream Ciphers\n\n\nSynchronous Stream Ciphers\n\n\nA Synchronous Stream Cipher generates a keystream based on internal states \nnot\n related to the plaintext or ciphertext. This means that the stream is generated pseudorandomly outside of the context of what is being encrypted. A \nbinary additive stream cipher\n is the term used for a stream cipher which XOR's the bits with the bits of the plaintext. Encryption and decryption require that the synchronus state cipher be in the same state, otherwise the message cannot be decrypted. \n\n\nSelf-synchronizing Stream Ciphers\n\n\nA Self-synchronizing Stream Cipher, also known as an asynchronous stream cipher or ciphertext autokey (CTAK), is a stream cipher which uses the previous \nN\n digits in order to compute the keystream used for the next \nN\n characters.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSeems a lot like block ciphers doesn't it? That's because block cipher feedback mode (CFB) is an example of a self-synchronizing stream ciphers.\n\n\n\n\nStream Cipher Vulnerabilities\n\n\nKey Reuse\n\n\nThe key tenet of using stream ciphers securely is to \nNEVER\n repeat key use because of the communative property of XOR. If C\n1\n and C\n2\n have been XOR'd with a key K, retrieving that key K is trivial because C\n1\n XOR C\n2\n = P\n1\n XOR P\n2\n and having an english language based XOR means that cryptoanalysis tools such as a character frequency analysis will work well due to the low entropy of the english language.\n\n\nBit-flipping Attack\n\n\nAnother key tenet of using stream ciphers securely is considering that just because a message has been decrypted, it does not mean the message has not been tampered with. Because decryption is based on state, if an attacker knows the layout of the plaintext, a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack can flip a bit during transit altering the underlying ciphertext. If a ciphertext decrypts to 'Transfer $1000', then a middleman can flip a single bit in order for the ciphertext to decrypt to 'Transfer $9000' because changing a single character in the ciphertext does not affect the state in a synchronus stream cipher.",

Because the  ping  command is being terminated and the  ls  command is being added on, the  ls  command will be run in addition to the empty ping command!  This is the core concept behind command injection. The  ls  command could of course be switched with another command (e.g. wget, curl, bash, etc.)  Command injection is a very common means of privelege escalation within web applications and applications that interface with system commands. Many kinds of home routers take user input and directly append it to a system command. For this reason, many of those home router models are vulnerable to command injection.",

It is inlined into HTML. A word of advice is to keep the php docs open because function names are strange due to the fact that the length of function name is used to be the key in PHP's internal dictionary, so function names were shortened/lengthened to make the lookup faster.

This basically means that the registers used for this architecture extend an extra 32-bits on Intel's x86 architecture. CISC means that a single instruction can do a bunch of diferent things at once such as memory accesses, register reads, etc. It is also a variable-length instruction set which means diferent instructions can be diferent sizes ranging from 1 to 16 bytes long. And finally x86-64 allows for multi-sized register access which means that you can access certain parts of a register which are diferent sizes.\n\n\nx86-64 Registers\n\n\nx86-64 registers behave similarly to other architectures. A key component of x86-64 registers is multi-sized access which means the register RAX can have its lower 32 bits accessed with EAX. The next lower 16 bits can be accessed with AX and the lowest 8 bits can be accessed with AL which allows for the compuler to make optimizations which boost program execution.\n\n\n\nx86-64 has plenty of registers to use including rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, rsp, rip, r8-r15, and more! But some registers serve special purposes.\n\n\nThe special registers include:\n- RIP: the instruction pointer\n- RSP: the stack pointer\n- RBP: the base pointer\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nAn \ninstruction\n represents a single operation for the CPU to perform.\n\n\nThere are diferent types of instructions including:\n\n\n\n\nData movement: \nmov rax, [rsp - 0x40]\n\n\nArithmetic: \nadd rbx, rcx\n\n\nControl-flow: \njne 0x8000400\n\n\n\n\nBecause x86-64 is a CISC architecture, instructions can be quite complex for machine code such as \nrepne scasb\n which repeats up to ECX times over memory at EDI looking for NULL byte (0x00), decrementing ECX each byte (Essentially strlen() in a single instruction!)\n\n\nIt is important to remember that an instruction really is just memory, this idea will become useful with Return Oriented Programming or ROP.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nInstructions, numbers, strings, everything!

This is determined by the RIP register where IP means instruction pointer. Execution follows the pattern: fetch the instruction at the address in RIP, decode it, run it.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nmov rax, 0xdeadbeef\n\n\n\n\nHere the operation \nmov\n is moving the \"immeadiate\" \n0xdeadbeef\n into the register \nRAX\n\n\n\n\nmov rax, [0xdeadbeef + rbx * 4]\n\n\n\n\nHere the operation \nmov\n is moving the data at the address of \n[0xdeadbeef + RBX*4]\n into the register \nRAX\n.

These conditionals are checking EFLAGS which are special registers which store flags on certain instructions such as \nadd rax, rbx\n which sets the o (overflow) flag if the sum is greater than a 64-bit register can hold, and wraps around. You can jump based on that with a \njo\n instruction. The most important thing to remember is the cmp instruction:\n\n\ncmp rax, rbx\njle error\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assembly jumps if RAX \n= RBX\n\n\nAddresses\n\n\nMemory acts similarly to a big array where the indices of this \"array\" are memory addresses. Remember from earlier:\n\n\nmov rax, [0xdeadbeef]\n\n\nThe square brackets mean \"get the data at this address\". This is analagous to the C/C++ syntax: \nrax = *0xdeadbeef;",

It was first used to reimplement the Unix operating system which was purely written in assembly language. At first, the Unix developers were considering using a language called \"B\" but because B wasn't optimized for the target computer, the C language was created.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nC is the letter and the programming language after B!\n\n\n\n\nC was designed to be close to assembly and is still widely used in lower level programming where speed and control are needed (operating systems, embedded systems). C was also very influential to other programming langauges used today. Notable languages include C++, Objective-C, Golang, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Rust.\n\n\nHello World\n\n\nC is an ancestor of many other programming languages and if you are familiar with programming, it's likely that C will be at least someewhat familiar.\n\n\n#include\n \nstdio.h\n\n\nint\n \nmain\n()\n\n\n{\n\n   \nprintf\n(\nHello, World!\n);\n\n   \nreturn\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\n\n\nToday C is widely used either as a low level programming langauge or is the base language that other programming languages are implemented in.\n\n\nWhile it can be difficult to see, the C language compiles down directly into machine code. The compiler is programmed to process the provided C code and emit assembly that's targetted to whatever operating system and architecture the compiler is set to use.\n\n\nSome common compilers include:\n\n\n\n\ngcc\n\n\nclang\n\n\n\n\nA good way to explore this relationship is to use this online \nGCC Explorer\n from Matt Godbolt.\n\n\n\n\nIn regards to CTF, many reverse engineering and exploitation CTF challenges are written in C because the language compiles down directly to assembly and there are little to no safeguards in the language. This means developers must manually handle both. Of course, this can lead to mistakes which can sometimes lead to security issues.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOther higher level langauges like Python manage memory and garbage collection for you. Google Golang was inspired by C but adds in functionality like garbage collection, and memory safety.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some examples of famously vulnerable functions in C which are still available and can still result in vulnerabilities:\n\n\n\n\ngets\n - Can result in buffer overflows\n\n\nstrcpy\n - Can result in buffer overflows\n\n\nstrcat\n - Can result in buffer overflows\n\n\nstrcmp\n - Can result in timing attacks\n\n\n\n\nTypes\n\n\nC has four basic types:\n\n\n\n\nchar - characters\n\n\nint - integers (e.g. 125)\n\n\nfloat - 32 bit floating point number (e.g. 2.4)\n\n\ndouble - 64 bit floating point number (like a float but more precise in terms of decimal points)\n\n\n\n\nPointers\n\n\nC uses an idea known as pointers. A pointer is a variable which contains the address of another variable.\n\n\nTo understand this idea we should first understand that memory is laid out in terms of addresses and data gets stored at these addresses.\n\n\nTake the following example of defining an integer in C:\n\n\nint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n4\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the programmer this is the variable \nx\n receiving the value of 4. The computer stores this value in some location in memory. For example we can say that address \n0x1000\n now holds the value \n4\n. The computer knows to directly access the memory and retrieve the value \n4\n whenever the programmer tries to use the \nx\n variable. If we were to say \nx + 4\n, the computer would give you \n8\n instead of \n0x1004\n.\n\n\nBut in C we can retrieve the memory address being used to hold the 4 value (i.e. 0x1000) by using the \n character and using \n*\n to create an \"integer pointer\" type.\n\n\nint\n*\n \ny\n \n=\n \nx\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ny\n variable will store the address pointed to by the \nx\nvariable (0x1000).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \n*\n character allows us to declare pointer variables but also allows us to access the value stored at a pointer. For example, entering \n*y\n allows us to access the 4 value instead of 0x1000.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever we use the \ny\n variable we are using the memory address, but if we use the x variable we use the value stored at the memory address.\n\n\nArrays\n\n\nArrays are a grouping of objects of the same type. They are typically created with the following syntax:\n\n\ntype\n \narrayName\n \n[\n \narraySize\n \n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo initialize values in the array we can do:\n\n\nint\n \nintegers\n[\n \n10\n \n]\n \n=\n \n{\n1\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n5\n,\n \n6\n,\n \n7\n,\n \n8\n,\n \n9\n,\n \n10\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrays allow programmers to group data into logical containers.\n\n\nTo access the indiviual elements of an array we access the contents by their \"index\". Most programming langauges today start counting from 0. So to take our previous example:\n\n\nint\n \nintegers\n[\n \n10\n \n]\n \n=\n \n{\n1\n,\n \n2\n,\n \n3\n,\n \n4\n,\n \n5\n,\n \n6\n,\n \n7\n,\n \n8\n,\n \n9\n,\n \n10\n};\n\n\n/*     indexes        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo access the value 6 we would use index 5:\n\n\nintegers\n[\n5\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do arrays work?\n\n\nArrays are a clever combination of multiplication, pointers, and programming.\n\n\nBecause the computer knows the data type used for every element in the array, the computer needs to simply multiply the size of the data type by the index you are looking for and then add this value to the address of the beginning of the array.\n\n\nFor example if we know that the base address of an array is 1000 and we know that each integer takes 8 bytes, we know that if we have 8 integers right next to each other, we can get the integer at the 4th index with the following math:\n\n\n1000\n \n+\n \n(\n4\n \n*\n \n8\n)\n \n=\n  \n1032\n\n\n\n\n\n\narray\n \n[\n \n1\n   \n,\n \n2\n   \n,\n \n3\n   \n,\n \n4\n   \n,\n \n5\n   \n,\n \n6\n   \n,\n \n7\n   \n,\n \n8\n   \n]\n\n\nindex\n   \n0\n     \n1\n     \n2\n     \n3\n     \n4\n     \n5\n     \n6\n     \n7\n\n\naddrs\n  \n1000\n  \n1008\n  \n1016\n  \n1024\n  \n1032\n  \n1040\n  \n1048\n  \n1056\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory Management",

This makes it very useful to security researchers and CTF players who often need to analyze obscure files without knowing what they are or where they came from. IDA also features the industry leading Hex Rays decompiler which can convert assembly code back into a pseudo code like format.   IDA also has a plugin interface which has been used to create some successful plugins that can make reverse engineering easier:   https://github.com/google/binnavi  https://github.com/yegord/snowman  https://github.com/gaasedelen/lighthouse  https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora  https://github.com/REhints/HexRaysCodeXplorer  https://github.com/isislab/Fentanyl",

            "text": "The Stack\n\n\nIn computer architecture, the stack is a hardware manifestation of the stack data structure (a Last In, First Out queue).\n\n\nIn x86, the stack is simply an area in RAM that was chosen to be the stack - there is no special hardware to store stack contents. The \nesp\n/\nrsp\n register holds the address in memory where the bottom of the stack resides. When something is \npush\ned to the stack, \nesp\n decrements by 4 (or 8 on 64-bit x86), and the value that was \npush\ned is stored at that location in memory. Likewise, when a \npop\n instruction is executed, the value at \nesp\n is retrieved (i.e. \nesp\n is dereferenced), and\n\nesp\n is then incremented by 4 (or 8).\n\n\nN.B. The stack \"grows\" down to lower memory addresses!\n\n\nConventionally, \nebp\n/\nrbp\n contains the address of the top of the current \nstack frame\n, and so sometimes local variables are referenced as an offset relative to \nebp\n rather than an offset to \nesp\n.

Well, if we carefully line up our input so that the bytes that overwrite \nsecret\n happen to be the bytes that represent 0x1337 in little-endian, we'll see the secret message.\n\n\nA small Python one-liner will work nicely: \npython -c \nprint \nA\n*100 + \n\\x31\\x13\\x00\\x00\n\n\nThis will fill the \nname\n buffer with 100 'A's, then overwrite \nsecret\n with the 32-bit little-endian encoding of 0x1337.\n\n\nGoing one step further\n\n\nAs discussed on \nthe stack\n page, the instruction that the current function should jump to when it is done is also saved on the stack (denoted as \"Saved EIP\" in the above stack diagrams). If we can overwrite this, we can control where the program jumps after \nmain\n finishes running, giving us the ability to control what the program does entirely.\n\n\nUsually, the end objective in binary exploitation is to get a shell (often called \"popping a shell\") on the remote computer. The shell provides us with an easy way to run \nanything\n we want on the target computer.\n\n\nSay there happens to be a nice function that does this defined somewhere else in the program that we normally can't get to:\n\n\nvoid\n \ngive_shell\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nsystem\n(\n/bin/sh\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell with our buffer overflow knowledge, now we can! All we have to do is overwrite the saved EIP on the stack to the address where \ngive_shell\n is. Then, when main returns, it will pop that address off of the stack and jump to it, running \ngive_shell\n, and giving us our shell.\n\n\nAssuming \ngive_shell\n is at 0x08048fd0, we could use something like this: \npython -c \nprint \nA\n*108 + \n\\xd0\\x8f\\x04\\x08\n\n\nWe send 108 'A's to overwrite the 100 bytes that is allocated for \nname\n, the 4 bytes for \nsecret\n, and the 4 bytes for the saved EBP. Then we simply send the little-endian form of \ngive_shell\n's address, and we would get a shell!\n\n\nThis idea is extended on in \nReturn Oriented Programming",

If we can overwrite this, we can control where the program jumps after  main  finishes running, giving us the ability to control what the program does entirely.  Usually, the end objective in binary exploitation is to get a shell (often called \"popping a shell\") on the remote computer. The shell provides us with an easy way to run  anything  we want on the target computer.  Say there happens to be a nice function that does this defined somewhere else in the program that we normally can't get to:  void   give_shell ()   { \n     system ( /bin/sh );  }   Well with our buffer overflow knowledge, now we can! All we have to do is overwrite the saved EIP on the stack to the address where  give_shell  is. Then, when main returns, it will pop that address off of the stack and jump to it, running  give_shell , and giving us our shell.  Assuming  give_shell  is at 0x08048fd0, we could use something like this:  python -c  print  A *108 +  \\xd0\\x8f\\x04\\x08  We send 108 'A's to overwrite the 100 bytes that is allocated for  name , the 4 bytes for  secret , and the 4 bytes for the saved EBP.

This document describes the protocol, lists some\n   of the implementations currently available, and has an overview of\n   how to implement new client and server applications.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n   This specification describes a modernized expression of the semantics\n   of the Gopher Internet protocol, referred to as Gopher version 2\n   (Gopher/2).\n\n   This specification obsoletes version 1 of the Internet Gopher\n   Protocol.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n   The Internet Gopher protocol is a wildly successful protocol.\n   It is currently the primary communications mechanisms for people\n   across the world. However it is missing several core mechanisms\n   for guaranteeing security. Additionally, it is lacking capabilities\n   for user interfaces and modern web document formatting.\n\n   The Gopher/2 defines a key exchange protocol for safe, end-to-end\n   encryption. Additionally, it defines a GopherText format for rendering\n   webpages.\n\n   The Internet Gopher/2 protocol and software follow a client-server\n   model. This model assumes reliable data stream; TCP is assumed.\n   Gopher/2 servers should listen on port 433. Documents reside on many\n   autonomous servers on the Internet. Users run client software on\n   their desktop, connecting to a server and completing a verification\n   process before sending the server a selector (a line of text, which\n   may not be empty) via a TCP connection at a well-known port. The server\n   responds with a block of text and closes the connection.\n\n   Servers return documents. The first line of the response contains the\n   type of the document and 4-byte big endian length of the document encoded in\n   hex and subsequent lines contain the contents of the document terminated by\n   end of file.\n\n   The GopherText format contains a list of Gopher/2 routes which the\n   client will then recursively request.\n\n\n2. The Internet Gopher/2 Model\n   Gopher/2 provides an optimized transport for Gopher semantics.\n   It supports all of the core features of Gopher but aims to be more\n   secure in several ways.\n\n   In essence, the Gopher protocol consists of a client connecting to a\n   server and sending the server a selector (a line of text, which may not\n   be empty) via a TCP connection.\n\n\n3. Gopher/2 Protocol Overview\n\n   In this simple example, the client establishes a connection and\n   requests the base page of the server.\n\n    {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n    Client: {Sends a single forward slash Meaning \nList what you have\n}\n    /\n    Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending in CR LF}\n    P17\n    T Welcome to our page\n    {Server closes connection}\n\n\n3.1. Connection Handshake\n\n   Connection will be established with a diffie-hellman key exchange.\n   This will establish the encryption key for subsequent communication\n   between client and server.\n\n   In the diffie-hellman exchange, let p = 251 and g = 6\n\n  Client: {Opens connection to web.chal.csaw.io at port 433 and\n           sends diffie-hellman A value.}\n  Server: {Accepts connection and says diffie hellman B value}\n  {Communication continues with messages encrypted by coordinated key}\n\n   The communication will be encrypted with repeated key xor using the\n   shared secret established by diffie hellman.\n\n\n3.2. Client Requests\n\n   Media item requests:\n\n  \nSelector\n    \nKey/Values...\n\n  /asdffile     Token1:ade912e4912b1c ...\n\n\n3.3. Server responses\n\n   The first line in a server response will be the item type followed by\n   the length of the return value encoded in hex. Subsequent lines will\n   be the content of the page. The following are the server response\n   types.\n\n  P   Item is a GopherText page\n  G   Item is a GIF format graphics file.\n  I   Item is some kind of image file.\n  S   Item is sound file (especially the WAV format).\n  F   Item is a file.\n\n\n   In the following example, the client requests a page on the server\n   with a token as an argument. The page the server returns will have a\n   Gopher2 media file in it. The client will reestablish another\n   connection to get the contents from the server.\n\n  {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n  Client: {Sends magic string and session tokens}\n  /index username:uname sessionToken:eae12ade\n  Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending in CR LF}\n  P41\n  T Welcome to our page, uname\n  I /imagename/png web.chal.csaw.io  433\n  {Connection closes}\n\n  {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n  Client: {Sends a request for the image}\n  /imagename/png  username:uname sessionToken:eae12ade\n  Server: {Responds with file type and contents of PNG}\n  IDEAD\n  .PNG....\n  {Connection closes}\n\n\n4. GopherText Pages\n\n   The client software decides what items are available by looking at the\n   first character of each line in a directory listing. Augmenting this\n   list can extend the protocol.\n\n\n4.1. GopherText Static Text Types\n   A list of defined item-type characters. The client will decide how to\n   handle distinctions between text types.\n\n   Text type is formatted as follows:\n\n  \nItem Type\n \nText\n\n\n   The following are the available text types:\n\n  T   Text\n  E   Error\n\n\n4.2.

This document describes the protocol, lists some\n   of the implementations currently available, and has an overview of\n   how to implement new client and server applications.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n   This specification describes a modernized expression of the semantics\n   of the Gopher Internet protocol, referred to as Gopher version 2\n   (Gopher/2).\n\n   This specification obsoletes version 1 of the Internet Gopher\n   Protocol.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n   The Internet Gopher protocol is a wildly successful protocol.\n   It is currently the primary communications mechanisms for people\n   across the world. However it is missing several core mechanisms\n   for guaranteeing security. Additionally, it is lacking capabilities\n   for user interfaces and modern web document formatting.\n\n   The Gopher/2 defines a key exchange protocol for safe, end-to-end\n   encryption. Additionally, it defines a GopherText format for rendering\n   webpages.\n\n   The Internet Gopher/2 protocol and software follow a client-server\n   model. This model assumes reliable data stream; TCP is assumed.\n   Gopher/2 servers should listen on port 433. Documents reside on many\n   autonomous servers on the Internet. Users run client software on\n   their desktop, connecting to a server and completing a verification\n   process before sending the server a selector (a line of text, which\n   may not be empty) via a TCP connection at a well-known port. The server\n   responds with a block of text and closes the connection.\n\n   Servers return documents. The first line of the response contains the\n   type of the document and 4-byte big endian length of the document encoded in\n   hex and subsequent lines contain the contents of the document terminated by\n   end of file.\n\n   The GopherText format contains a list of Gopher/2 routes which the\n   client will then recursively request.\n\n\n2. The Internet Gopher/2 Model\n   Gopher/2 provides an optimized transport for Gopher semantics.\n   It supports all of the core features of Gopher but aims to be more\n   secure in several ways.\n\n   In essence, the Gopher protocol consists of a client connecting to a\n   server and sending the server a selector (a line of text, which may not\n   be empty) via a TCP connection.\n\n\n3. Gopher/2 Protocol Overview\n\n   In this simple example, the client establishes a connection and\n   requests the base page of the server.\n\n    {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n    Client: {Sends a single forward slash Meaning  List what you have }\n    /\n    Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending in CR LF}\n    P17\n    T Welcome to our page\n    {Server closes connection}\n\n\n3.1. Connection Handshake\n\n   Connection will be established with a diffie-hellman key exchange.\n   This will establish the encryption key for subsequent communication\n   between client and server.\n\n   In the diffie-hellman exchange, let p = 251 and g = 6\n\n  Client: {Opens connection to web.chal.csaw.io at port 433 and\n           sends diffie-hellman A value.}\n  Server: {Accepts connection and says diffie hellman B value}\n  {Communication continues with messages encrypted by coordinated key}\n\n   The communication will be encrypted with repeated key xor using the\n   shared secret established by diffie hellman.\n\n\n3.2. Client Requests\n\n   Media item requests:\n\n   Selector      Key/Values... \n  /asdffile     Token1:ade912e4912b1c ...\n\n\n3.3. Server responses\n\n   The first line in a server response will be the item type followed by\n   the length of the return value encoded in hex. Subsequent lines will\n   be the content of the page. The following are the server response\n   types.\n\n  P   Item is a GopherText page\n  G   Item is a GIF format graphics file.\n  I   Item is some kind of image file.\n  S   Item is sound file (especially the WAV format).\n  F   Item is a file.\n\n\n   In the following example, the client requests a page on the server\n   with a token as an argument. The page the server returns will have a\n   Gopher2 media file in it. The client will reestablish another\n   connection to get the contents from the server.\n\n  {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n  Client: {Sends magic string and session tokens}\n  /index username:uname sessionToken:eae12ade\n  Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending in CR LF}\n  P41\n  T Welcome to our page, uname\n  I /imagename/png web.chal.csaw.io  433\n  {Connection closes}\n\n  {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n  Client: {Sends a request for the image}\n  /imagename/png  username:uname sessionToken:eae12ade\n  Server: {Responds with file type and contents of PNG}\n  IDEAD\n  .PNG....\n  {Connection closes}\n\n\n4. GopherText Pages\n\n   The client software decides what items are available by looking at the\n   first character of each line in a directory listing. Augmenting this\n   list can extend the protocol.\n\n\n4.1. GopherText Static Text Types\n   A list of defined item-type characters. The client will decide how to\n   handle distinctions between text types.\n\n   Text type is formatted as follows:\n\n   Item Type   Text \n\n   The following are the available text types:\n\n  T   Text\n  E   Error\n\n\n4.2. GopherText Media Types\n\n   Used as this:\n\n   Item Type   Selector   Hostname         Port   Key/Values... \n  I           /asdf/png  web.chal.csaw.io 433    Token1:a912e4912b1c ...\n\n  Where the Selector also defines how the client will download the file.\n  E.g. /asdf/png will be downloaded as asdf.png\n  The client is disallowed from downloading files above the client s directory\n  for security purposes.\n\n   These are the following media item types.\n\n  G   Item is a GIF format graphics file. Client fetches and decides how\n       to display.\n  I   Item is some kind of image file. Client fetches and decides how to\n       display.\n  S   Item is sound file (especially the WAV format). Client will fetch\n       and play.\n  F   Item is a file. Client will fetch and download.\n  L   Item is a link to another Gopher/2 page.\n  P   Item is a nested browsing context. Client will fetch and render\n      as nested client.\n\n\n4.3. Session Storage Types\n\n   GopherText pages can return session storage entries to set Session\n   cookies on the client. The client will store it and append it to other\n   requests to the same server.\n\n  C   Key : Value          Key : Value        ...\n  C  Token1:Token1Value   Token2:Token2Value  ...\n\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n   Gopher/2 addresses security issues by defining standards for\n   implementation of it s client and server with emphasis on cutting-edge\n   best advancements for cyber-security such as cyber-security through\n   obscurity, cyber-security through litigation, and cyber-security\n   through libel.\n\n\nExamples\n\n   An example implementation of Gopher/2 is available at\n\n      gopher://web.chal.csaw.io",
